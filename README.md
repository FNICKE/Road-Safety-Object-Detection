# Road Safety Object Detection Project

This project aims to detect objects (such as helmets, pedestrians, vehicles, etc.) in real-time video feeds to promote road safety. The project uses Python and OpenCV for video capture and object detection, ensuring safety on the roads by monitoring and alerting the driver for necessary actions.

## Features

- Real-time object detection from the webcam.
- Detects road safety objects (such as helmets and vehicles).
- Alerts and notifications for safety violations.
- Uses deep learning models for detection (e.g., YOLOv8 or custom models).
- Simple, user-friendly interface for ease of use.

## Languages & Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **OpenCV**: For accessing the camera and processing video frames.
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: For real-time object detection.
- **Twilio**: (Optional) For sending SMS notifications when violations are detected.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for model training (if you are training your own models).
