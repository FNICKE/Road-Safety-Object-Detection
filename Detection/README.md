# Road Safety Project

This project aims to monitor road safety using computer vision techniques. It detects vehicles, calculates their speed, and monitors driver attention to prevent accidents.

## Features:
- Real-time vehicle detection using YOLO
- Speed detection using optical flow
- Driver attention monitoring using face detection

## Requirements:
- OpenCV
- Twilio (for SMS alerts)
- NumPy

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.
